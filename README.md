# FIFA Statistik-Tracker - React Migration

This project has been migrated from vanilla JavaScript to a modern React + Tailwind CSS architecture while maintaining all existing functionality.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks
- **Tailwind CSS 3** - Utility-first CSS framework (replacing the old pre-built CSS)
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Supabase** - Backend and authentication
- **React Hot Toast** - Toast notifications
- **PWA Support** - Progressive Web App with service worker

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Opens at http://localhost:3000

- ✅ Progressive Web App (PWA) support
- ✅ Responsive design with bottom navigation
- ✅ Modern soccer-themed UI
- ✅ Real-time data with Supabase
- ✅ Tab navigation (Spiele, Kader, Sperren, Finanzen, Stats, Spieler)

## 🎯 Architecture Changes

### From Vanilla JS to React
- **Before**: ES6 modules with manual DOM manipulation
- **After**: React components with hooks and state management

### From Pre-built CSS to Tailwind
- **Before**: Pre-built `tailwind-play-output.css` + custom CSS
- **After**: Modern Tailwind CSS build system with custom configuration

### Improved Developer Experience
- **Hot module reloading** during development
- **TypeScript-ready** (can add .ts/.tsx files)
- **ESLint** configuration for code quality
- **Vite** for fast builds and development

## 🔄 Migration Status

### ✅ Completed
- Core React architecture setup
- Authentication system
